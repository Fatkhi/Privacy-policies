Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 17, 2025

Wine Guide SF (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS application handles your information.

1. Information We Collect

Wine Guide SF does not collect, store, process, or share any personal data or usage data through our app.

This includes (but is not limited to):

No personal information

No contact information

No account data

No device identifiers

No analytics or usage tracking

No cookies or tracking technologies

No data transmitted to our servers

2. Location Data

Wine Guide SF requests access to your device’s location, but:

Your location is used only on your device

We do not collect, store, or transmit your location to any server

Your location is not shared with any third party

Your location is used solely to show nearby wineries and wind bar locations on the map

Example:
The app uses your current location to display nearby wineries and wind bar recommendations relative to your position.

Apple requires location permission to display this contextual map information, but Wine Guide SF does not persist or process this data outside of your device.

3. Limited Third-Party API Use (Google Places API)

Wine Guide SF uses the Google Places API exclusively to:

Display winery images

Display wind bar location information

This API is used in a read-only manner to fetch publicly available data.

Importantly:

We do not send your personal data or location to Google

Google does not receive any user-identifying information from the app

The app retrieves only business/place data (e.g., photos, names, coordinates)

4. Data Storage

Since we do not collect personal information, we do not store any data locally or externally.

All location usage happens in real time on your device and is not recorded.

5. Data Sharing

We do not share any personal data with third parties because we do not collect any personal data.

The only external service accessed is Google Places, and only for public place information as described above.

6. Third-Party Services

Aside from the limited use of Google Places API, Wine Guide SF does not use:

Analytics tools

Advertising networks

Data collection SDKs

Tracking frameworks

7. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
Since the app collects no personal information from any user, it remains suitable for all ages.

8. Security

Even though we collect no personal data, we remain committed to secure software practices and minimizing access to protected device resources.

9. Changes to This Policy

If our privacy practices change, this Privacy Policy will be updated. You will be notified of significant changes within the app or through an updated version release.
