Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 17, 2025

Wine Guide SF (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS application handles your information.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, process, or share any personal data or usage data through our app.
This includes (but is not limited to):

No personal information

No contact information

No device identifiers

No location data

No usage analytics

No cookies or tracking technologies

No data transmitted to our servers

2. Limited Third-Party API Use

Wine Guide SF uses the Google Places API exclusively to:

Display winery images

Display wine bar locations

This integration is read-only and is used solely to retrieve publicly available information from Google’s databases.
No personal data is sent to Google, and Google Places does not receive any user-identifying information from our app.

3. Data Storage

Since we do not collect any information, we do not store any personal data—either locally on your device or on any external servers.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share any personal data with third parties because we do not collect any data in the first place.
The only external service used is Google Places, strictly for retrieving non-user-specific content as described above.

5. Third-Party Services

Aside from the limited use of the Google Places API, Wine Guide SF does not use any third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, or advertising networks that collect user data.

6. Children’s Privacy

Wine Guide SF does not collect any personal data from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

7. Security

While no personal information is collected or stored, we remain committed to maintaining a secure app environment and adhering to best practices for software development.

8. Changes to This Policy

If our privacy practices change, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. You will be notified of any significant changes within the app or through an updated version release.
